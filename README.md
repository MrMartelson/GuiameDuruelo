# GuiameDuruelo 

This is the final app for the Android Developer Nanodegree.

The app is a small tourist guide for people coming to Duruelo de la Sierra, a spanish small town. 

The final objetive is that the app can show you a list of restaurants, hotels, turistic points and services, both in a list and in a map. 
Also, the app will detect if you are in the town area and if you are, it will send you a notification at lunch/dinner time.
